===========

A very simple command-line imap client.

#####How does it work?
```
$ node index.js #execute index.js
$ Imap> check #issue command 'check' when prompted for input. You may also use the 'c' command.
$ Check mail

$ Connecting...
$ Mailbox opened

$ Done fetching all messages.
$
$ Imap> quit #issue command to exit app
```

That's it (for now).
